    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Chess is one of the most popular board games in the world. Originating from the 15th century, the game has withstood the test of time, and has grown tremendously during the modern era. A game that requires immense strategic knowledge to master, but little barriers to entry, Chess is a relatively simple game with one objective: to capture the king.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player receives the same assortment of pieces at the start of each game: a collection of pawns, rooks, bishops, knights, a king, and a queen. Each piece has its own abilities; pieces that have better abilities are more powerful and have more positional value. As previously mentioned, the goal of every chess game is to capture the king, but this is usually done in three stages: the opening, the midgame, and the endgame. The most quantifiable of these stages is the opening: the first series of organized moves that a player makes. These moves are part of pre established patterns, and each unique pattern has its own name. For our purposes, the larger group of patterns is referred to as the **chess openings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every chess game has one limitation: time. Specifically, each player receives the same amount of time to make all their moves, and in some configurations can receive additional time for every move they make. The total amount of time they receive at the start of the game is referred to as the **base** and the additional time they may receive after each move is referred to as the **increment**. The total time limitation format is referred to as the **time constraint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Chess grew in popularity, organizations have taken steps to standardize the game. One large part of this has been initiatives to standardize player ratings. Currently, the standard measure of a Chess player’s skill is their **ELO rating**. ELO ratings range from around 200 to 2800, and are based on a highly mathematical formula to determine the probability of a win between two players of similar skill levels. When two players face each other, there exists an **ELO rating differential**, which signifies the difference in their ELO ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative strength of openings is a frequently debated topic: countless players, authors, and content creators have claimed foolproof methods of choosing the best opening. On the other hand, ELO rating differential is a seemingly mathematical concept: given a certain differential, we should expect a certain win probability. Here, we want to assess these two concepts against each other by determining if the ELO rating differential or the opening type played is a better indicator of win probability. We started by examining, cleaning, and conducting basic statistical analysis on a dataset of ~6 Million chess games played during July of 2016 on Lichess, a free online chess server.\n"

    "# Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**For what purpose was the dataset created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created to analyze our research question which looks at if ELO rating differential or opening type played is a better indicator of win probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The funding for the original dataset is unknown at this time, but all data was published by lichess.org. Lichess is a not-profit organization that runs its free, open-source, online chess server. Players can play chess games with registered accounts or play them anonymously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of the data represent individual games played on the lichess platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many instances are there in total?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes approximately 620,000 individual games after our extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample of instances from a larger set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset does not include all possible instances, as we chose to only include 10% of the instances from the larger raw dataset extracted from Kaggle. Additionally, because the data was collected over a brief period of time using only one online platform, it is not immediately clear if it is representative of all chess games played.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted statistical analyses, checking if the difference in densities for openings played and time controls was different between our dataset and the larger dataset. These analyses found no noticeable differences, ensuring that our dataset was representative of the larger set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Rows:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents an individual chess game played\n",
    "\n",
    "***Columns:***\n",
    "\n",
    "* Result: The result of each game, denoted by '1-0' for White winning, '0-1' for Black winning, and '0.5-0.5' for a draw.\n",
    "* WhiteElo: The ELO rating for the player using white pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "* BlackElo: The ELO rating for the player using black pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "* WhiteRatingDiff: The ELO rating differential from the perspective of the player using white pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ECO: The Encyclopedia Chess Opening codes which denotes the opening moves used by each player via a shorthand code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opening: The full name of each opening strategy, a pattern of moves a player uses to open the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time Control: The time limit for each game in seconds (time limits broken down into the format ‘Base Time + Increment’)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Termination: The Termination of each game (how each game was ended). The two main ones are:\n",
    "    * Normal - a player was checkmated (left with no more moves)\n",
    "    * Time forfeit - a player's base time reached 0 seconds before either player was able to complete the game\n",
    "\n",
    "* Base Time is the total base time in minutes given to each player for the entire game\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increment is the additional time (seconds) added to each player’s total time after each of their respective moves\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is any information missing from individual instances?**\n",
    "No. Data was cleaned such that each instance is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is the dataset self-contained or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources?**\n",
    "The dataset is self-contained. Although the data was extracted from an online chess platform, our extraction of data remains static.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**How was the data associated with each instance acquired?**\n",
    "The data was collected from lichess where each instance corresponds to a chess game played on lichess. However, it is not directly clear where on lichess this data came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Over what timeframe was the data collected?**\n",
    "Per the data description on Kaggle, the data was collected over all chess games played on Lichess in July of 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Did you collect data from individuals in question directly or obtain it via third parties or other sources?**\n",
    "Our data does collect information about people, as each chess player is associated with an actual person. The data was not collected from these individuals directly but was obtained from Lichess, the platform where they played chess.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection, and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**\n",
    "Yes, Lichess does explicitly notify individuals of data collection for statistical purposes, as outlined in their privacy policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "“In order to maintain statistics relating to the games that took place on the lichess.org site and in particular to allow you to know your history of the games played as well as your ranking, we will keep your username and other non-personal information, such as party metadata.\n",
    "This further processing is compatible with the initial collection of your username, justified by the execution of the contract in accordance with Article 6.1.b of the GDPR as indicated in point 2 above, in accordance with recital 50 and Articles 5 and 89 of the GDPR.”\n",
    "    \n",
    "As indicated in the above privacy policy, individuals expected their data to be used for statistical purposes, which falls within the bounds of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done?**\n",
    "Yes, the data was taken from a relatively raw format and preprocessed to be analyzable. This involved a couple of steps. First, we shrunk down the data into 10% of its original size, in order to make our analysis more efficient. We also worked to clean some columns, removing instances where columns had unexpected or invalid values, such as termination due to cheating or abandonment. We compared our preprocessed data to the raw dataset, ensuring that our preprocessed data was not noticeably different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data?**\n",
    "Yes. A link to this data is below:\n",
    "https://cornell.box.com/s/tey4tig1xn8ngpml1x0c866nvkz65jkj\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses\n",
    "**Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?**\n",
    "Yes. The dataset has been used to quantify high-level summary statistics and draw charts including histograms, density charts, and bar charts. These summary diagrams have given us some insight into the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?**\n",
    "The dataset will be used to run more complicated statistical testing, including a hypothesis test, to better quantify our research question.\n"

    "### Opening Type Classification Strategy\n",
    "In order to preform statistical tests on the list of openings to compare it to the rating differential, we needed to classify the openings into groupings. The groupings were determined based on the play type of each opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of an opening strategy is:**\n",
    "1. **Development:** Mobilize pieces to place them on useful squares to have a strong impact on the game.\n",
    "2. **Control of the center of the board:** Having control of the center allows the player to move the pieces more easily around the board and have greater control of non-center squares.\n",
    "3. **King safety:** To prevent a player from losing the game, the king must remain safe. Openings tend to have the goal of removing the heightened risk of keeping the king in the center.\n",
    "4. **Prevention of pawn weaknesses:** Preventing pawn weaknesses, including isolating pawns, doubling pawns, etc., allow for a stronger attack or defense.\n",
    "5. **Piece coordination:** During an opening, coordinating the pieces allow for a stronger attack or defense to improve the overall position.\n",

    "# Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of obvious limitations to our raw and analysis-ready dataset. The first limitation comes from the source of our data. Specifically, because this is data collected for all games played on the Lichess platform during July 2016, it cannot be said to be representative of all games played on Lichess, or even all games played on chess platforms on the internet. More specifically, there are other massively popular online chess websites (chess.com or chess24.com, etc.) which also have millions of games played every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is further amplified by the fact that a large number of chess games aren’t played online, and no data exists for them. Some data exists for in-person chess games, but these are usually limited to tournaments, and don’t usually account for amateur players or other over-the-board games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of our data relates to our Termination values. There were four unique values here, ‘Abandoned’, ‘Time forfeit’, ‘Normal’, and ‘Rules Infraction’. Rules Infraction was used to denote games where one player was found to be cheating, based on if they were playing suspiciously above a human level. One limitation of this data is that players could have cheated on games but not been caught by the Lichess platform. This is a relatively common occurrence, and can add noise to data on game results.\n"
